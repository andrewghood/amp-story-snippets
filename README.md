# AMP Story Snippets README

## Features

This collection of snippets is intended to assist in the development of AMP Story components within AMP HTML pages. An AMP Story is basically a browser-enabled version of the popular 'story' format used by Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. It's for telling visual stories using text, images, GIF animations and videos. If you're unfamiliar with the AMP Story component, head over to AMP's website and [learn to create your own](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/visual_story/?format=stories).

The list of available snippets related to AMP Story development are below:

### Known Issues

This is my first time ever making an extension for VS Code so functionality might be a bit... <em>limited</em> compared to what you're used to from other developers. I'll update it more in the future.
